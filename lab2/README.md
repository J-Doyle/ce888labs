I split the data into two .csv files and plotted scatter for both
![logo](./vehicle_current_Scater.png?raw=true)
![logo](./vehicle_new_Scater.png?raw=true)
Then plotted histogram
![logo](./vehicle_current_histogram.png?raw=true)
![logo](./vehicle_new_histogram.png?raw=true)

The standard deviation for each sample was:
Current fleet: 6.401805
New Fleet:	6.068931

The Upper and Lower bounds after 10,000 bootstraps:
Current fleet
Lower: 5.813246
Upper: 6.931866
New fleet
Lower: 5.151066
Upper: 6.881841

These bounds overlap so you cannot make any conclusions as they could be the same data
